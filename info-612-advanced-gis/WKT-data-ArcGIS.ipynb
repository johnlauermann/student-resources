    "# Using WKT Location Data in ArcGIS\n",
    "[Well-Known Text (WKT)](https://libgeos.org/specifications/wkt/) is a format that stores geometry information as a string within a table. When stored in this way, each row in the table (such as a CSV file) will include an attribute that describes the geometry of a shape, stored as a string value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notation starts by defining the type of geometric shape (e.g. POINT, POLYGON). It then includes longitude and latitude coordinates for each relevant point in the shape (e.g. if it's a polygon, every vertex along the polygon boundary will be listed). \n",
    "\n",
    "ArcGIS does not have a direct way to import WKT data. But there is a fromWKT function within the `arcpy` library. This script demonstrates how to use it"

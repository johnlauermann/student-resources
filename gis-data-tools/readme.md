# GIS Data Tools

This folder contains `Python` and `R` scripts for workflows related to GIS data. These scripts are designed for use by students in *INFO 609: Introduction to GIS* ([syllabus here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12yGMVudxXN7SucW7SQUyU-JvBgKiau84/view?usp=sharing))and *INFO 612: Advanced GIS* ([syllabus here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BcuuuCltPbhB7VNosS7dBsa76bCbRo-K/view?usp=drive_link)). They are, for the most part, designed to interface with a broader GIS workflow in ArcGIS Pro and/or ArcGIS Online.
